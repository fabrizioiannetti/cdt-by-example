= Managed build with compile commands database parser =

A project that uses managed build (but with makefile not generated by CDT)
and a compile commands database parser.

== Importing ==

Some paths are stored as absolute, so the project *must* be located at

----
/local/cdt-by-example/mb_compile_commands
----

It can then be imported as an existing eclipse project into any workspace.

== Building ==

The project is based on `cmake` so one needs to configure it first:

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON ..
----

the CDT build is set up to use `build/Makefile`.
